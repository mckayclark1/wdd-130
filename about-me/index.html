    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Robert 'McKay' Clark</h2>
    <h2>I go by McKay</h2>
    <p>I am from Meridian, Idaho. I was born in Ogden, Utah and lived there till I was four then at that point, moved to
        Roseville, California. After a couple years I moved to Meridian and have been there ever since.
        I am in my fourth semester and currently majoring in Computer Information Technologies (CIT). I love to play
        video games of all varieties from first-person shooters like Call of Duty to masterfully crafted single player
        campaign games like Elden Ring.
        Aside from video games I also love to listen to Hard Rock / Metal, EDM, Soundtracks of all kinds, and some pop
        music. I enjoy table top board and card games like Magic the Gathering, Chess, Pokemon, and one of my recent
        favorites, Betrayal at House on the Hill.
        I am currently a Full-Time Student here at BYUI and I love the community down here and the activities that are
        put on by the school and it's students. I am taking this couse because I feel it will give me valuable coding
        knoledge and experience that can ultimately help me pursue a job in CyberSecurity.
        I have been a member all of my life and I would have to say my favorite scripture would have to be Helaman 5:12.
        It's my favorite because it gives us confidence that we can trust in our Savior to help us through the difficult
        times in our lives.</p>
